Aggressive Work Miner - All bots will be mining constantly, even if the user is active.

Mine if user is not active - Will only mine if the user is not active.

Disable CPU mining vRam 6+GB and user is not active - This option disables mining on processors if the user is active and mining on a card of 6GB or more, as this brings a good income. The option sacrifices mining on the processor so as not to overload the PC.

The build has a weight of 100-120kb, when using Confuser 300-400kb. Also, the weight depends on the number of wallets added to the clipper.

Build has a dependency starting from .Net Framework 4.0 and above. Written in C# .Net 4.0.

UAC ByPass - Stealthily gets administrator rights without pop-ups.

At the first infection, it deletes itself from the original launch location, copies it to the system folder, registers it in startup and increases in weight from 700 to 800 MB, this weight significantly improves the survivability of the build in the system, many antiviruses do not send such files to cloud scanning for analysis, and most importantly, this Do not upload weight to VirusTotal.
Clipper supports adding multiple addresses for each currency, will replace the addresses in the clipboard when the victim uses copy/paste, the more addresses the better Clipper selects the most similar Wallet to the original from your list of addresses.
